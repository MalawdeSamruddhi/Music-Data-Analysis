# Music-Data-Analysis

### In this internship project we have analyzed and visualized the data from the dataset and plotted the correlation between various features of the musical attributes. 

* The music data has been taken from Kaggle website. The dataset contains various dependable and significant factors of music along with their respective values. It is in the format of a csv file which consists of 25709 rows and 16 columns. The columns includes features such as 'Artist Name', 'Track Name', 'Popularity', 'danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode', etc.
* Of these 16 features, 'Artist Name' and 'Track Name' are of object type, 'mode' and 'time_signature' are of int type and all the remaining ones are of data type float. 
* The data previously contained some null values which were detected and replaced by 0 during the preprocessing.
